# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. This game allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid, where they take turns marking spaces with 'X' and 'O'. The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

- **2-player gameplay**: Players take turns to place 'X' and 'O'.
- **Board display**: The board is printed after each move to show the current state.
- **Win conditions**: The game checks for win conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
- **Tie detection**: The game detects a tie if the board is full without a winner.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for implementing the game logic and user interface.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the `TickTakToe.java` file in any Java IDE or from the command line.
3. The game will prompt each player to enter a number (1-9) corresponding to a cell on the grid.
4. The game alternates turns between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
5. The game ends when a player wins or all cells are filled (tie).
